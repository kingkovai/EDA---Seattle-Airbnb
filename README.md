# Exploratory data analysis - Seattle Airbnb data

## Project motivation
   We intend to do exploratory data analysis on the Seattle Airbnb data to answer below three questions
 - Which part of the year airbnbs are cheaper in Seattle ?
 - Does the Airbnb listing goes down during the cheaper months ?
 - Do visitors tend to review less during cheaper months ?
